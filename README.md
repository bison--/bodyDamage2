# bodyDamage2
In 2013 I fell down the stairs, wrote a program to calculate the damage I took ^^. This is a ~9 year after remake with [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui).  
The original: https://github.com/bison--/bodyDamage

## Story ##

I fell down the stairs and would tweet about it, with a damage report.  
Then I remembered my bad math skills and I am too lazy to calculate em.  
So I wrote a program for me to do it ^^

## Installation ##

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## RUN ##

```bash
python3 start.py
```
